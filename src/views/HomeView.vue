    <h1>Welcome to Dine-Review!</h1>

    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>Dine-Review is a gathering spot for friends, family, and anyone connected to our circle. Here, you can explore most authentic reviews of restaurants across Berlin.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Simply share your thoughts by adding reviews of the restaurants you visit. Simply input the restaurant and a review about your dining experience.</p>

    <h2>A Collaborative Community</h2>
    <p>We pride ourselves on being an open blog - a platform built on trust and mutual respect. With no login or authentication barriers, we encourage our users to contribute responsibly. Your inputs not only guide your friends and family but also help build a comprehensive guide for anyone exploring Berlin's vibrant food scene.</p>

    <h2>Our Guiding Principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Respect and Honesty</strong>: Every review is a reflection of personal experience. We ask that you be honest yet respectful in your critiques.</li>
      <li><strong>Inclusivity and Community</strong>: Dine-Review is a community. We encourage you to invite friends and family to join and share their experiences.</li>
      <li><strong>No Commercial Ties</strong>: This platform is a personal project and not for commercial use.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsible Sharing</strong>: Since we don't require logins, we count on you to be mindful of what you share, keeping the information accurate and helpful.</li>
